# Regression: Support Vector Regression (SVR)

### Introduction

In this exercise, we will work with a dataset containing chemical properties of wine, and our goal is to predict the **quality** of red wine based on these properties. The target variable is the **quality score**, which is a continuous value representing the wine's quality, and the features include chemical properties such as acidity, sugar content, and alcohol levels. This is a **regression task**, where we aim to estimate a continuous numeric value based on input data.

To solve this problem, we will use **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**. SVR is a machine learning model used for regression tasks that works by finding a hyperplane in a high-dimensional space that best fits the data. The key advantage of SVR is its ability to work well with both linear and non-linear relationships in the data, making it an great choice when the relationship between the features and target variable is not straightforward (like in this red wine quality example).

### SVR Works Well for This Problem

1. **Handling Non-Linear Relationships**:
   - **Non-linear patterns**: Wine quality is influenced by a variety of factors, such as acidity, sugar, and alcohol content, which might not have a linear relationship with the target. SVR works well in capturing these non-linear relationships by using a kernel trick, transforming the data into a higher-dimensional space where a linear hyperplane can be found to best separate the data.

2. **Robustness to Outliers**:
   - **Insensitive to small errors**: One of the strengths of SVR is its ability to ignore small variations and focus on the general trend in the data. It does this by defining a margin of tolerance around the predicted values, where small errors are not penalized. This helps SVR focus on large, meaningful patterns while being less sensitive to noisy or outlying data points.

3. **Regularization**:
   - **Controlling model complexity**: SVR allows us to control the complexity of the model through regularization, which helps prevent overfitting. By tuning the **C** parameter, we can balance between fitting the data well and keeping the model simple, avoiding the risk of overfitting to noise in the data.

### Dataset Overview

The **Wine Quality Dataset** contains the following features:

- **Fixed Acidity**: Amount of fixed acids (e.g., tartaric acid)
- **Volatile Acidity**: Amount of acetic acid
- **Citric Acid**: Amount of citric acid
- **Residual Sugar**: Amount of sugar remaining after fermentation
- **Chlorides**: Salt content
- **Sulfur Dioxide**: Amount of free sulfur dioxide
- **Density**: Density of the wine
- **pH**: Acidity level
- **Sulphates**: Amount of sulphates
- **Alcohol**: Alcohol content

These features contribute to the final wine quality score, which is a continuous variable. Using SVR, we will model the relationship between these features and the target quality score to predict wine quality based on chemical composition.

### What's Next?

Let's implement an SVR model to predict red wine quality. You will explore how to prepare the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance using various metrics.
