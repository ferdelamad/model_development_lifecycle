# Regression Models for Machine Learning

### Introduction

In this section, we will explore the concept of **regression** in machine learning, a powerful technique for predicting continuous values. Regression models are a subset of **shallow learning algorithms**, which are designed to learn from a dataset and make predictions based on input features. <br />
Unlike deep learning models, shallow learning algorithms are simpler, faster, and often easier to interpret, making them an excellent starting point for solving real-world problems such as predicting house prices 🏡, sales forecasting 📊, or stock price predictions 📈.

By the end of this section, you will have hands-on experience with **Linear Regression**, one of the most widely used regression algorithms. You will learn how to train a model, evaluate its performance, and compare predicted values with actual outcomes.

### Common Regression Algorithms

Here are the most common regression algorithms we will explore in this section:

- 🏡 **Linear Regression**: The simplest form of regression, where the model learns the relationship between input features and the target variable as a straight line.
  - 📚 [Exercise - Predicting House Prices](./linear/README.md) - In this example, we predict house prices based on features like area, number of bedrooms, and age of the house.

- 🏞️ **Random Forest Regression**: A tree-based ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.
  - 📚 [Exercise - Predicting Bike Rentals](./random-forest/README.md) - Let's predict the number of bike rentals based on features like season, weather, time of day, and holiday status.

- 📉 **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: A non-linear regression method that uses the principles of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict continuous values by finding the optimal hyperplane.

- 🌱 **Ridge Regression**: A variation of linear regression that includes a regularization term to avoid overfitting.

- 🔢 **K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN)**: A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that predicts the target value by averaging the values of the nearest neighbors in the feature space.
