# Regression Models for Machine Learning

> "Building the future of technology, one algorithm at a time."

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Model Development Lifecycle** repository, where we focus on building and deploying machine learning models with a hands-on approach. <br />
This project currently walks you through various regression models (more content üîú), from simple **Linear Regression** to more advanced methods like **Random Forest Regression** and **Support Vector Regression**.

Here, you'll find practical examples and exercises to help you understand how to train, evaluate, and deploy regression models in Python. Whether you're a beginner or looking to sharpen your skills, this repo will guide you through the most commonly used techniques in machine learning.


## üöÄ What's Inside:

- Practical, hands-on examples
- Clear explanations of the implementation, models an algorithms
